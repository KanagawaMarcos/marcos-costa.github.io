# Study Process

1. Read a book whitouth implementing anything in it. 
> This serves the porpuses of ensuring that I actually finish any book that I might start. And also suits the fact that and better at implement anything after a have a broader vision of the whole thing a building. The problem to this approach is to build things that might never been built before by humanity.
2. I create a simple project plan and structure it's tasks.
3. I prioritize the tasks using math based on my goals with that project.
4. Build whole CI/CD infrastructure prior to any code.
5. Build tests to describe the specification of what I'm going to build.
7. Start my development cycle.
8. Document the results.
9. Ensure some acceptances tests like: running with a single command etc
